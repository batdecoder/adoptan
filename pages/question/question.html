                    </div>
                    <p>“Animal welfare,” as defined by the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, is a human responsibility that encompasses all aspects of animal well-being, including proper housing, management, nutrition, disease prevention, responsible care, humane handling, and, where necessary, humane euthanasia. As an animal welfare organization, we believe that humans can interact with animals in entertainment, industry, sport and recreation, but that the interaction should include provisions for the proper care and humane management of all animals involved.
                       
                        We use scientific and legal arguments to promote and advocate for the protection of animals from cruelty. “Animal rights” is a philosophical view that seeks to end the exploitation of animals and animal use industries, including the slaughter of animals for consumption, animal research, animals used in entertainment or education, service animals, working animals and companion animals. Animal rights groups typically avoid working with organizations involved in these practices and may employ confrontational methods to promote change.
                        
                        We work cooperatively and collaboratively with pet owners, farmers, landowners, producers, veterinarians, and breeders on issues that affect animals, and we actively work with municipal and provincial governments to ensure animals are provided with every possible protection under the law.

                        The Ontario SPCA is proud to be Ontario's largest animal welfare organization, and one of the most responsive animal welfare organizations in Canada. Partnerships, based on professionalism, openness and understanding foster a spirit of goodwill and trust that helps us achieve changes that may otherwise not be possible.</p>

                        <h3>什么是“禁杀”设施？</h3>
                    </div>           
                    <p>The term “no kill” can be a contentious one in animal sheltering and the term is used differently by different groups. A true “no kill” facility is one where animals are kept alive at any cost, and no animal is euthanized, regardless of the state of health (including emotional health) or temperament. Unfortunately, many of these facilities do not recognize that emotional and behavioural suffering is just as damaging as physical suffering, and/or will adopt out animals with aggressive temperaments who are a danger to the community.

                        For example, if an animal is physically healthy, but is showing signs of emotional distress in the form of behaviours caused by living in a kennel or cage for years, a true “no kill” facility would keep the animal alive, without consideration for the emotional and behavioural suffering this animal is experiencing. Ideally, the animal would be provided with in-shelter enrichment and/or the opportunity to go to foster care to alleviate emotional distress, but this isn't always an option for many facilities.
                        
                        Unfortunately, many of these facilities are more like warehouses for animals, rather than safe havens. There are other groups who refer to themselves as “no kill”, who actually will euthanize animals, thereby negating the term “no-kill”. Often these groups euthanize only for health-related reasons and often only in the case where the animal could not live without on-going physical suffering. Again, these can be places that do not recognize or treat emotional or behavioural distress or suffering. There are also limited admission facilities that often also refer to themselves as “no kill”. These facilities pre-screen the animals admitted into their shelter, usually choosing not to admit animals who suffer from behavioural problems, aggression, or suffer from any illness. These groups often take only the easiest to adopt animals, thereby allowing them to say they are “no kill” simply because the animals they take in are easy animals to adopt back out again.
                        
                        Other animals who do not meet the admission requirements are simply referred to other facilities. If a shelter has a “no kill” policy, it is important for the public to ask the shelter to define the “no kill” policy, so that the public may understand which definition the shelter is practicing. The ASPCA has a similar philosophy towards “no kill” facilities: “The ASPCA believes that unwanted pets deserve a dignified, painless death rather than suffer from such cruelties as malnutrition, disease or trauma, outcomes commonly associated with an unwanted and/or uncared-for existence. Similarly, long-term housing of individual dogs and cats in cages without access to exercise or social activities is not an acceptable alternative. Euthanasia must be understood for what it is: a last-step, end-of-the-road option to spare animals further hardship and suffering.” For more information on the ASPCA, please visit aspca.org.</p>

                        <h3>工作猫计划</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>One of the goals of the Ontario SPCA when rehoming animals is to find the right home for each animal in its care. Sometimes community cats, which some people refer to feral cats, end up in our centres and cannot be returned to their original colony site for various reasons. The cats require alternative homes due to their lack of socialization.

                        The Ontario SPCA believes in finding an alternative home for these feral cats by giving them “jobs” as working cats! These cats are healthy, spay/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and ear tipped to indicate they have been spayed/neutered. Working cats are not suited to be indoor pets and, as unsocialized animals, they have no desire to be lap cats. What they need is a new rural outdoor home, such as a barn, stable, garage, or warehouse.
                        
                        As former street cats who are used to outdoor life, working cats are not typical indoor pets and have no desire to be lap cats. However, what they lack in social skills they make up for when it comes to keeping vermin problems under control. For the small cost of a bowl of cat food and water daily, veterinary care and shelter, they’re ready to go to work.</p>
